content = "You can make a loop using the [code]while[/code] keyword followed by a block of code. The lines inside a [code]while[/code] loop will be run over and over until the expression after the [code]while[/code] keyword fails:
[code]
var counter:int
counter = 0
while counter < 3:
	print(counter)
	counter = counter + 1
[/code]
This should check if [code]counter[/code] is less than three, if not, print it, and increase it by one, and repeat. After 3 loops, the value of [code]counter[/code] will be [code]3[/code], so the check will fail and the loop will exit.

This should print:
[code]0
1
2
[/code]"
