content = "You can make a loop using the [code]for[/code] keyword followed by a block of code. The lines inside a [code]for[/code] loop will be run over and over until the expression after the [code]for[/code] keyword fails:
[code]
for i in [1, 2, 3]:
	print(i)
[/code]
This should iterate over the array and print the values in it. When it is done, the loop will exit.
This should print:
[code]1
2
3
[/code]"
